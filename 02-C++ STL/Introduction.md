STL stands for Standard Template Library.
They are divided into:
1>Containers 
2> Iterators
3> Algorithms
4> Functors


***CONTAINERS***
These are Data Structures that are pre implemented in the libraries.
Here we have sequential, Ordered and Unordered type of containers
Sequential --> Vectors, stack, Queue,pair
Ordered --> maps, multimaps sets, multisets
Unordered --> unordered map, unordered Sets

***NESTED CONTAINERS***
vector<vector<int>>
map<int,vector<int>>..etc.

***ITERATORS***
point to memory address of containers(somewhat similar to pointers!)
begin(),end()
