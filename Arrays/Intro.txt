STATIC VS DYNAMIC ARRAY 

STATIC- Size cannot be changed
In C program, Size have to be declared at compile time 
but in cpp it can be done at runtime using cin>>n;A[n];
A Normal array is created only in stack but we wewant to create a array into a heap
then we have to make a pointer for that (vvv imp.)
Look at the notebook for more!
DYNAMIC-Can be changed 
Now stack array cannot be resized at all but heap
array alternatives like arraylist linkedlist can be resized!
